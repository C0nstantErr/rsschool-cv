## About myself
I’ve always been interested in learning smth new. As for me, Frontend-development is the best sphere, because it places heavy demands on you motivating to constant self-improvment, but at the same time it gives you enough space for creative work. So, I’m here to gain system knowledges and skills in order to get an offer in future. I think that my strengths which are hard-working and curiosity will help me to succeed.
